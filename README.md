Why TAUT?
----------------
TAUT proposes a fast circulation currency without inflation. Users collectively grow and secure the network by doing essential behavior - transactions. With the technology innovation of "Proof Of Transaction", users with transaction history are rewarded by sharing the future block reward. No advantage is for concentrating wealth and hardware such as in POS and POW. Low barrier to get coins and rewarding to daily commoners behavior are TAUT implementation of fairness.
